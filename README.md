  <strong>The only Android library, your project probably ever need</strong>
</p>

## Motivations

I started this project as a hobby, beside improving my skill as a developer but to see how can I
improve my experience in developing Android application.

We already know every time we start a new project, we usually take some time to setup the project
with something like:

- Adding necessary dependencies to the project, where we usually already know what dependencies to
  use based on the requirements of current project and our experience from past project, so
  basically a simple copy paste will do the trick
- Before any feature implementation, building the base class for things like `Activity`,
  `Fragment`, and perhaps `RecyclerView` adapter. All of those things and implement any
  functionalities that we think might be useful later so we don't have to write it over and over
  again.
- Share your initial increments to other developers, perhaps you do things differently one way and
  use different libraries so you communication at the start of project become very important

Basically what I want to achieve is to reduce all of those repetitive tasks when starting new
project so I can start just building the feature as soon as possible.

I know that you can already do that using boilerplate where you run a command in terminal and by
inputting some parameters, you can get ready to use project with all dependencies and setup provided
for you. But that's just one way ticket, and you can't get any improvements if there's new
tech/libraries come along. So I want to do that by building a library / package / dependency that
you can gradually use, and you can just update the version when there's new feature or bugfix.
